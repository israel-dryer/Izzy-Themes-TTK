# Message Catalog Setup

Instructions for setting up a message catalog file for ttkbootstrap

1. Create a new .msg file with the language prefix codes. See the zh_cn.msg file as an example of this. The codes should be separated with an underscore '\_' as in 'zh_cn' >>
    https://wiki.freepascal.org/Language_Codes

2. Add the following pattern for each word you want to translate:

    ::msgcat::mcset  zh_cn "Letter " "信 "

    - The first item is "::msgcat::mcset"
