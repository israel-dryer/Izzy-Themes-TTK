## Create a new theme

All of the controls for changing the theme are on the left-side control 
frame. 

1. Name your theme using the **name** entry

2. Select a **base theme**; this will setup the _initial_ colors

3. Select a color for each color _keyword_ using one of two options
    
    * Click the ðŸŽ¨ button to choose a color from the color dialog
    * Or, type a _hexadecimal_ or valid color _name_ 

4. Click the **Save** button

Your theme is now saved in the file `ttkbootstrap.themes.user.py`

!!! tip "Reset your theme"
    If you want to reset your color choices, you can click the 
    **Reset** option from the top menu to reset all of the colors
    to the **base theme** colors.

## Import user themes

If you have a user themes file that is in the format specified below, you can 
import that file into ttkbootstrap. 

1. Click the **Import** button on the top menu

2. Select the themes file you wish to import, then click **Ok** to import

!!! warning
    Importing a user themes file will overwrite the existing user defined
    themes within ttkbootstrap; so make sure you **export** your existing
    theme set if you wish to keep it

The `user.py` file contains a dictionary of user defined themes. The file that
you import must match the pattern illustrated below.

```python
USER_THEMES = {
    "supercosmo": {
        "type": "light",
        "colors": {
            "primary": "#2780e3",
            "secondary": "#7E8081",
            "success": "#3fb618",
            "info": "#9954bb",
            "warning": "#ff7518",
            "danger": "#ff0039",
            "light":"#F8F9FA",
            "dark": "#373A3C",
            "bg": "#ffffff",
            "fg": "#373a3c",
            "selectbg": "#7e8081",

            "inputbg": "#fdfdfe"
        }
    }
}
```
